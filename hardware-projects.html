                <p>An emulation of the retro classic Arcade Game Mortal Kombat</p>
                <div class="details">
                    <p> This 2-player handheld game is powered by the TI TIVA TM4C123G lauchpad. Custom-built hardware includes buttons for menu item selection/ attack, DACs for sound output, ADCs for joystick sampling, wireless receiver 
                        and transmitter antennas for serialized player-to-player communication, and an LCD screen for display.
                        The main game routine is programmed in C. C++ modules are used to initialize hardware and communication protocols. Hardware interrupts are triggered on player input and are serviced using interrupt service routines.
                        Busy-Wait threads and sempahores are used for synchronization of interrupts, enabling concurrency. 
                        Bounding Volume Hierarchy(BVH) algorithm is used for collision detection to process events where a player strikes the other and adjust health bar. This algorithm encloses the player sprites into geometric shapes and assesses overlap.
                        Race conditions are caused by 2 players striking at the same time, which are solved by a randomization algorithm which arbitrarily sets priority.
                        SPI communication module is implemented for communication with LCD screen. Serialization is configured using queues for firt-in-first-out data retrieval. Error codes are used error-checking and debugging.
                        Images are stored as hexadecimal pixel matrices, and are loaded into buffers for display. 
                        Sounds/ music are stored as WAV files comprising discretely sampled pulses and are read periodically for playback.
